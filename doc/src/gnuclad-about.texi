@section Contact

The most recent version of gnuclad and it's documentation can be
downloaded at @uref{https://launchpad.net/gnuclad}.

You can also file bugs and contact the developers there.

@section Purpose

gnuclad has been written to facilitate progress of the GNU/Linux distro
timeline project (GLDT).

Meanwhile it has become quite customisable and general application -
for example in genealogy or visualisation of hierarchical structures -
should be possible.

@section Documentation

The documentation is distributed together with gnuclad and can be found in the
'doc' folder.
