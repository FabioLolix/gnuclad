@node Config Options
@chapter Config Options

@section Default settings

Every config option has a preset default which will be used if there is no
override.
In the same spirit, a default configuration will be used if you specify no
config file.

@section Generate a config file

You can always generate a full configuration file by specifying CONF as
gnuclad's output:
@example

gnuclad input.csv CONF
gnuclad input.csv config-file.conf
gnuclad input.csv conf another.conf
@end example
The last line will use the settings as available from 'another.conf' and
complement them with the built-in defaults.
The 'input.csv' will be ignored. It can be an empty dummy file.

#   option= 'value'
#   option ="value"
#   option = three word value
#   option = "three word value"
