gnuclad is built with the GNU toolchain.
These tools are included in most GNU/Linux and BSD distributions and can
be obtained from the Xcode developer package on OSX.
On Windows, compilation works flawlessly with MinGW & MSYS.
Other build systems may work but have not been tested.

To compile gnuclad, open this folder in a terminal and type:
  sh configure
  make

This will produce a 'gnuclad' binary in the 'src' folder.
Change to the 'example' folder and generate your first SVG image:
  cd example
  ../src/gnuclad --help
  ../src/gnuclad example.csv svg example.conf

In order to install gnuclad on a POSIX conform system, change back to
the main directory and run the install routine:
  cd ..
  make install

You should now be able to call gnuclad from any folder.
If you wish to uninstall gnuclad, simply open a terminal in that same
main folder and execute:
  make uninstall
